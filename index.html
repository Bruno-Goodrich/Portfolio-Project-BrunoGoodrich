      <h3>Binary Seach Game</h3>
      <p>In this project I had to work in a group to create a game that utilizes the idea of binary search. We were in groups so we also learned how to do pair programming. My group craeted a guessing game where the program tries to guess the state you are thinking of. It does this by breaking the states down into groups and asking about those. For instance if the stae you chose was Maine the first question it asks is what region is it in. You would respond "North East". It then will ask if its apart of New England, you'd respond "yes". It then asks if your state is north of Massachusetts, you'd say "Yes". It will finally then guess Maine Here's the code for just that:</p>
      <pre><code id="BinarySearch" lang="js">
         </code>

      <h3>Creating this Portfolio</h3>
      <p>For this project I had to create this sad looking portfolio that you are viewing. I know, absolutely amazing. This projet was my first time using HTML and CSS and was challenging at first just trying to figure them out. I got the hang of them pretty quick and got going. However I didn’t get very far as the most challenging part of creating this was my many absences from this class during work time. I tried working outside of class but didn’t really get to far but it ended up alright. I didn’t really get to fool around to much with things like libraries and stuff so its pretty bare bones and is basically what I could do with the small time I used to complete it. This is definitely something I want too improve much pass the state its currently and will try to work on through the year and hopefully have it look nicer. But for no this is it and here is some of the HTML an CSS
</p>
      <pre><code lang="html">

        This is the HTML for the the binary search description. The h3 just means it follows the rul of h3 in CSS and is the third style of heading. The p is the paragraph and tells the computer to put the block of text there. Pre and code are the, well... code. Id fragment is an piece of javascript that tells the computer to put that specific piece of javasrcipt coe there. Here is the CSS:
      </p>
      <pre><code lang="css">
        body {
          background-color:#262626;
        }

        title {
         font-size:100;  
        }


        h1{
          color:white;
          font-size:40
        }

        h2{
          color:white
        }

        h3{
          color:mintcream;
          border: 3px solid mintcream;
          border-radius:50px;
          padding:10px;
        }

        p {
          color: gainsboro;
          font-size:20px;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>The CSS i pretty simple. The body's backgroungd color is why this page is dark gray. The tiles fontsize is 100. Any h1 element in the html has white text and has a font size of 40. Any h2 element has white text. The h3 elmeent has the most interesting. All text is a mintcream color(off white) an they have a rounded border that is 3 pixels solid in the same color as the text. Border radius is what makes the border rounded and the padding is the amount space between the border and text inbetween. The paragraphs are all set to have a font size of 20 and be in the color of gainsboro(light gray yous see here). And thats it for the CSS.</p>
