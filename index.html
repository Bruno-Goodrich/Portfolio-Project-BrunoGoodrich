      <h3>Binary Seach Game</h3>
      <p>In this project I had to work in a group to create a game that utilizes the idea of binary search. We were in groups so we also learned how to do pair programming. My group craeted a guessing game where the program tries to guess the state you are thinking of. It does this by breaking the states down into groups and asking about those. For instance if the stae you chose was Maine the first question it asks is what region is it in. You would respond "North East". It then will ask if its apart of New England, you'd respond "yes". It then asks if your state is north of Massachusetts, you'd say "Yes". It will finally then guess Maine Here's the code for just that:</p>

      <h3>Creating this Portfolio</h3>
      <p>For this project I had to create this sad looking portfolio that you are viewing. I know, absolutely amazing. This projet was my first time using HTML and CSS and was challenging at first just trying to figure them out. I got the hang of them pretty quick and got going. However I didn’t get very far as the most challenging part of creating this was my many absences from this class during work time. I tried working outside of class but didn’t really get to far but it ended up alright. I didn’t really get to fool around to much with things like libraries and stuff so its pretty bare bones and is basically what I could do with the small time I used to complete it. This is definitely something I want too improve much pass the state its currently and will try to work on through the year and hopefully have it look nicer. But for no this is it and here is some of the HTML an CSS

        &lt;h3>Binary Seach Game&lt;/h3>
        &lt;p>In this project I had to work in a group to create a game that 
        utilizes the idea of binary search. We were in groups so we also learned 
        how to do pair programming. My group craeted a guessing game where the
        program tries to guess the state you are thinking of. It does this by
        breaking the states down into groups and asking about those. For instance if
        the stae you chose was Maine the first question it asks is what region is it
        in. You would respond "North East". It then will ask if its apart of 
        New England, you'd respond "yes". It then asks if your state is north of 
        Massachusetts, you'd say "Yes". It will finally then guess Maine Here's the 
        code for just that:&lt;/p>
        &lt;pre>&lt;code id="BinarySearch" lang="js">
        &lt;/code>
        &lt;/pre>
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the HTML for the the binary search description. The h3 just means it follows the rul of h3 in CSS and is the third style of heading. The p is the paragraph and tells the computer to put the block of text there. Pre and code are the, well... code. Id fragment is an piece of javascript that tells the computer to put that specific piece of javasrcipt coe there. Here is the CSS:
      </p>
      <pre><code lang="css">
        body {
          background-color:#262626;
        }

        h1{
          color:white;
          font-size:40
        }

        h2{
          color:white
        }

        h3{
          color:mintcream;
          border: 3px solid mintcream;
          border-radius:50px;
          padding:10px;
        }

        p {
          color: gainsboro;
          font-size:20px;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>The CSS i pretty simple. The body's backgroungd color is why this page is dark gray. Any h1 tag in the html has white text and has a font size of 40. Any h2 tag has white text. The h3 tag has the most interesting css. All text is a mintcream color(off white) and they have a rounded border that is 3 pixels solid in the same color as the text. Border radius is what makes the border rounded and the padding is the amount space between the border and text inbetween. The paragraphs are all set to have a font size of 20 and be in the color of gainsboro(light gray yous see here). And thats it for the CSS.</p>

      <h3>Mash Game</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>The goal of this project was to make a game using lists. I chose to create black jack using a list to make the cards. I first made the cards and then made a function to pull a random card from the deck. I then created another list for the players hand, and the random cards pulled from the deck were put there. I then made a another funciton to count the hands value. I then repeated this to create a cpu hand. Things I can improve would be to keep the cpu hands secret and to let the player stand.</p>
      <h4>Example One</h4>

      <h3>Image Processing</h3>
      <h4>Here is the Link to the Filters and Code:</h4>
      <a href="https://bruno-g-apcsp-filters.netlify.app">Filters</a>
      <br/><a href="https://github.com/IACS-CS/image-filters-Bruno-Goodrich">Github Repository</a>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>In this project I wast tasked with making filters for images. I did this by manipulating the red, green, blue, and alpha values of the pixels that make up the image. I created a sad filter that makes the image more blue and adds a vignette with code written by the one and only Tom Hinkle. I also created a color shift filter that kinda works and has options to change the R,G,B, and alpah added. There is also a brightness that was made as an introduction to how filters works.</p>
      <h4>Code Example</h4>
      <pre><code id="Sad" lang="js"></code></pre>
      <p>This is the code for the sad filter. It changes the image to be more blue with a vignette. The filter itself is an object with two methods. The first method is name which is, well, it's name and the second is the apply method which does the work of creating the filter. The way it works is by getting the array of pixels within the image and adding 50 to the red value of a pixel, 100 to the blue value, 50 to the green value, and subtracting 100 from the alpha value. It knows these values by using modulo of the 4 items of the pixel's array and saying if its the first item it is the red value, if it's the second it's green, third is blue, fourth is alpha. The last part calls upon another filter that adds a vignette and it's apply method to appear on the filtered image. Then it will be called and apply the filter.</p>

      <h3>Data Visualization Project</h3>
      <h4>Lninks:</h4>
      <a href="https://65e61965009c3c00080d2c68--buscrashdata.netlify.app/">Graph/Data</a>
      <br><a href="https://github.com/LucienRowland/data-viz-pulic-template">Github Repository</a>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>In this project we had to make charts/graphs using car crash data from Massachusets. This was a group project so I worked with My pals Lucien and Matt. We chose to focus our data on bus crashes ad make a barchart of how many crashes happen in each town. I created the graph and helped create the list of towns in each county. I mainly did coding and debugging.</p>
      <h4>Purpose and Function</h4>
      <p>The purpose of this project was to to allow a user to be able to see the number of school bus accidents in Massachusetts. The function of the project was to make a chart that displays the number of of school bus road incidents in Massachusetts in each town. It sorts these towns in counties to allow easier searchin and a smaller, easier to read graph.</p>
      <h4>Code Example one</h4>
      <pre><code id="BusCrashTowns" lang="ts"></code></pre>
      <p>To put it simply, this function takes the list of town names and counts the crashes in each town. It then makes an array with the name of the town and the amount of crashes in it. More specifically the newPieCounts and newPieData create a array of objects that consist of the name of a town and the number crashes. The filteredData function is what does the counting. It looks through the data, only at the part of the rows labled as "City Town Name", and adds each name it finds as the name of the object in the array. When it finds a repeat of that name it adds one to the crashs number in the object. So once it finds a town like Lowell, it will add an object to the array with the name and a crash, once it finds Lowell in the csv data again, it will add one to the crash counter. It then puts these obects into the array at the start.</p>
      <h4>Code Example two</h4>
      <pre><code id="townDropDown" lang="ts"></code></pre>
      <p>In this example, this snippet of code is what makes the drop down menu function. On the site you can chose which county to look at using a drop down menu. The code here isn't to create it but to make it function. It says that if the option for this county is slected in the drop down, then change the array of data to only count the names of towns that are in the array of the county. Not pictured here is the arrays we created for the counties, they're just strings of towns in the counties. This snippet of course is not the full function, just the Bs to make it short.</p>
