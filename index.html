      <h3>Binary Seach Game</h3>
      <p>In this project I had to work in a group to create a game that utilizes the idea of binary search. We were in groups so we also learned how to do pair programming. My group craeted a guessing game where the program tries to guess the state you are thinking of. It does this by breaking the states down into groups and asking about those. For instance if the stae you chose was Maine the first question it asks is what region is it in. You would respond "North East". It then will ask if its apart of New England, you'd respond "yes". It then asks if your state is north of Massachusetts, you'd say "Yes". It will finally then guess Maine Here's the code for just that:</p>
