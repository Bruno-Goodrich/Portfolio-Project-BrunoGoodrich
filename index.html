      <h3>Binary Seach Game</h3>
      <p>In this project I had to work in a group to create a game that utilizes the idea of binary search. We were in groups so we also learned how to do pair programming. My group craeted a guessing game where the program tries to guess the state you are thinking of. It does this by breaking the states down into groups and asking about those. For instance if the stae you chose was Maine the first question it asks is what region is it in. You would respond "North East". It then will ask if its apart of New England, you'd respond "yes". It then asks if your state is north of Massachusetts, you'd say "Yes". It will finally then guess Maine Here's the code for just that:</p>

      <h3>Creating this Portfolio</h3>
      <p>For this project I had to create this sad looking portfolio that you are viewing. I know, absolutely amazing. This projet was my first time using HTML and CSS and was challenging at first just trying to figure them out. I got the hang of them pretty quick and got going. However I didn’t get very far as the most challenging part of creating this was my many absences from this class during work time. I tried working outside of class but didn’t really get to far but it ended up alright. I didn’t really get to fool around to much with things like libraries and stuff so its pretty bare bones and is basically what I could do with the small time I used to complete it. This is definitely something I want too improve much pass the state its currently and will try to work on through the year and hopefully have it look nicer.
